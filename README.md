# Naive-Bayes-with-Mnist
the homework of Pattern Recognition with MATLAB.
The example notebook shows how you can use Matlab to build a classical naive bayes model (NB) to classify the Mnist.
It's also add the laplace correction which can greatly smooth the probabilistic function.
It tests the naive bayes model using the cross validation method and the final accuracy is 84.92%.
